The Gupta brother who may or may not be a fugitive from justice in South Africa has provided the Zondo State Capture inquiry with a six-page statement in which he categorically denies having met former deputy finance minister, Mcebisi Jonas, in October 2015 – or at any time before or after that.                              9 For starters, Ajay Gupta says he was nowhere near the Saxonwold compound where the alleged R600-million bribe was made to Mcebisi Jonas, nor the scene of the offer to make him the country’s finance minister.  7 No, Mr Gupta was at the family’s Oakbay offices and his “alibi” will be supported by none other than staff, including fraud and corruption accused, Ronica Ragavan.
