A still from Politically Aweh's 'South African women march for their lives' video. With Women’s Month 2018 still fresh in our minds, Politically Aweh takes a look at the persisting problem of gender-based violence in South Africa. Politically Aweh headed to the #TotalShutdown march on 1 August to talk to the women and gender non-conforming people on the front lines of the battle for a safer South Africa, and speaks to Wits-based gender violence researcher Lisa Vetten. Watch:  We also look at the politics of the ANC Women’s league organising their own march on the same day as #TheTotalShutdown, and check out the public sentiment on the Department of Women.
