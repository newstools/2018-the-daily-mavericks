Standard Bank was also asked why it continued to bank construction companies that had been fined for collusion in the construction of stadia… yet had closed the accounts of the Gupta entities that had not been convicted by any court.”  50 He added that while Standard Bank had no difficulty meeting with the governing party, “… the fact that the ANC requested the meeting at the behest of Oakbay (a Gupta family holding company) evidenced the extent of Oakbay’s political influence at the highest echelons of political office-bearers in South Africa.”  125 Mantashe said Sinton’s evidence was “to the extreme” and that his (Mantashe’s) recollection of the meeting was different.   78 “White monopoly capital was not our angle,” said Mantashe, who added, “I’m going to Tshabalala (Sim, the CEO of Standard Bank) to explain.”  109 Mantashe said he had always been opposed to the establishment of a Cabinet inter-ministerial committee led by then mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane to investigate the closure of the Gupta family accounts.  61 Asked why the ANC leadership had called in the banks, he said that it was “not unusual. The issue was topical. We didn’t pressure them (the banks).”  82 Mantashe revealed that FNB had refused to attend a meeting when called by the ANC while Nedbank CEO Mike Brown had met with the ANC of his own volition and not after being summonsed.  27 “We didn’t regard the meetings as hostile,” said Mantashe.
