Tony Jackman's Chilled Spanspek Soup. Photo: Louis Pieterse  Ingredients 1 spanspek
1 Apple
1 orange
1 onion
1 stick celery
2 garlic cloves
3 sprigs spearmint
1 or 2 star anise
Olive oil
750ml chicken or vegetable stock
Yoghurt Soften the finely chopped onion, celery and garlic in olive oil. Add chopped apple (cored and peeled), star anise, mint and the juice of an orange and simmer, stirring, for five minutes. (Any mint will do but I happen to grow spearmint.) Add the flesh of a spanspek and simmer for 5 minutes more, stirring now and then. Add 750ml stock, season lightly with salt and pepper, bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes. Cool, remove star anise, and blend to a fine consistency. Chill and serve with a drizzle of yoghurt and mint sprigs.
