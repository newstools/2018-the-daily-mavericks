Turkey Terrine. Photo by Louis Pieterse  Ingredients Meat of the legs, thighs and wings of 1 turkey, prepared as above
500ml turkey stock (use the cooking broth)
A handful of whole raw almonds
A handful of sultanas
20g powdered gelatine or 4 gelatine leaves Toast the almonds lightly in a dry pan. Grease a terrine dish or suitable loaf tin. Dice the turkey meat and put it into a bowl. Add the sultanas and almonds. Season to taste with salt and pepper and stir. Pack it loosely into the terrine, not tightly, so that the stock can flow through. Dissolve gelatine according to packet instructions and stir into the cooking stock. Pour into the terrine to fill. Refrigerate for 4 hours or more to set. Serve it with a cranberry relish: Spiced Cranberry Relish 100g dried cranberries
100ml cold water

1 star anise
1 bay leaf Combine water and sugar in a pot and cook, stirring, until dissolved. Add all other ingredients. Bring to a simmer and cook on a gentle heat until the liquid has reduced to a sticky syrup and the cranberries are soft. Cool and serve with the turkey terrine.
