Three women were assaulted and goods were stolen at the Polokwane franchise at the Mall of the North.  1 “We understand that the business owner is cooperating with authorities,” the Vodacom spokesperson explained.  3 Eff supporters have vandalized a Vodacom store at the Mall of the North in Polokwane.

DA lays charges against EFF supporters  2 “Vodacom believes in freedom of expression and would not censor Mr Msimang’s views or those of other opinion makers. “Vodacom is against discrimination and bigotry in all their manifestations, including race, age, gender, disability, religion, sexual orientation and political thought,” the company’s spokesperson added. The DA laid charges of accessory to crime and malicious damage to property on Monday against what it termed the “EFF hooligans” who vandalised the franchise.  4 “There is enough sufficient evidence that could have been linked to certain people, we will continue communicating with the South African Police Service to ensure that people are charged and held accountable for their actions,” DA Limpopo leader Jacques Smalle told the media outside Polokwane police station.  7 EFF provincial chairperson Jossey Buthane on Sunday told News24 that Smalle was only laying charges because he wanted to become the province’s premier.
