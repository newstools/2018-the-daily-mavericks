De Lille speaks out over allegations and water crisis, Boko Haram kill nine, and Trump "fit" for office. Wednesday, 17 January 2018 "The Law is a fortress on a hill that armies cannot take or floods wash away." The Prophet Muhammad STORY OF THE DAY Scorpio: Gupta-linked McKinsey and Trillian ‘collusive and patently corrupt’ – Asset Forfeiture Unit  1 By JESSICA BEZUIDENHOUT for SCORPIO “Without detracting from Trillian’s complicity in what is essentially theft of funds from Eskom, I submit that McKinsey played an instrumental role in siphoning the R1.6bn out of Eskom,” reads the statement in support of an application for a preservation order of the two companies assets. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING De Lille speaks with DM on water crisis Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has hit back hard against critics alleging that her attention was drawn away from the water crisis.
