Grammy Awards sees Kendrick Lamar dominate, Kabul attackers besiege academy, and Tiger Woods returns with a vengeance.  1 Monday, 29 January 2018 “Reality provides us with facts so romantic that imagination itself could add nothing to them.” Jules Verne  2 STORY OF THE DAY Trainspotter: The Purge By RICHARD POPLAK. The purge must happen. But to whom must it happen? What must happen to those it happens to? (Drawing and quartering? Internet shaming? Life in jail?) And what happens if it doesn’t go all the way to the top? WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING Kendrick Lamar leads the Grammys Kendrick Lamar has scooped up five Grammy awards this year. The glitzy music industry event was hosted in New York this year, the first time in 15 years it has not been in Los Angeles. The late Carrie Fisher won a Grammy as well for her spoken word album The Princess Diarist. The entire affair also saw another theme of protest against abuse, this time with white roses adorning the gowns and suits, coupled with the hashtag #TIMESUP.

A pre-dawn assault on the academy was still ongoing in the early hours of this morning, with Afghan security forces closing off roads nearby. An attack days earlier had killed at least 100 people, with the Taliban or Islamic State believed to be responsible. Furore over Fitbit security snafu A security analyst has discovered the locations of several military bases in Niger using the tracking data of Fitbit devices.

Someone in uniform is about to get the bollocking of his or her life. Woods 'pleased' with tour performance Tiger Woods has managed 23rd place at the Farmers Insurance Open. Woods said that he was pleased with the performance, the toughest yet for his surgically fused spine. Considering Woods' absence from the PGA Tour for years, his ability to return and manage 23rd place without much trouble is a positive signal for his 2018 career.
