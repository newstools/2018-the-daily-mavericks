A refreshing honesty and frankness in dealing with the critical issues facing the utility was revealed by new Eskom chairman Jabu Mabuza and acting CEO Phakamani Hadebe at the long awaited and delayed Eskom interim financial results presentation for the six-month period ending 30 September 2017. By CHRIS YELLAND.  Eskom’s interim financials revealed a decline in all financial metrics compared to those of the same period for the previous financial year, with sales revenue declining by 2% to R95.5-billion, operating costs remaining flat at R66,7-billion, net cash generated from operations declining by 30% to R22-billion, net finance costs increasing by 53% to R10-billion, and net profit after tax declining by 34% to R6.3-billion. Eskom’s financial position for the second half of the financial year ending 31 March 2018 traditionally worsens significantly, with lower sales revenue and higher maintenance costs than in the first half. Eskom’s year-end financials are therefore expected to reflect a significant net loss position. The release of Eskom’s interim financial results follows the recent liquidity crisis at the utility, the downgrade of Eskom’s credit rating by ratings agency, Moody’s, from B1 to Ba3, and concerns by banks, financial institutions and lenders in respect of the “going concern” status of Eskom as reflected by its apparent inability to meet loan capital and interest repayments from operating income for the months ahead. The liquidity crisis was attributed to poor leadership and governance by the previous Eskom chairman, board and executive management, with perceptions of maladministration and corruption by the financial community leading to difficulties in Eskom rolling over existing debt, obtaining bridging finance and raising new debt.
