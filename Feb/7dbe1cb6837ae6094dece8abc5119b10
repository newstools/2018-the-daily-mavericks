Nothing is more frustrating than analysts and journalists whose hatred and dislike of the Economic Freedom Fighters blinds their ability to not only see the truth, and to report it too. Gareth Van Onselen is one such journalist. He has a sworn dislike of the EFF and its internal workings which he describes using official documents like the party's constitution. Yet in all the five years of our existence, Van Onselen has never attended an EFF press conference or any of the party's assemblies, rallies, community meetings, in particular those at which the election of leadership is conducted or when there are debates about any policies. This, despite journalists being welcome to do so. By HLENGIWE MKHALIPHI.
