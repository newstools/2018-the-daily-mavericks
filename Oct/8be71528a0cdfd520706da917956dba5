Amazon.com Inc. raised its minimum wage for all employees in the U.S. amid increasing scrutiny of working conditions and compensation at the Internet retail giant. Effective Nov. 1, the wage increase applies to more than 250,000 current employees along with 100,000 more seasonal workers who will be hired during the holidays, Amazon said Tuesday in a statement. Company lobbyists will also begin advocating for an increase in the federal minimum wage, the statement said.
