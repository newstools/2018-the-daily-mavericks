Tokyo stocks opened lower on Wednesday as worries about a trade war resurfaced after the United States announced a new list of Chinese export goods subject to tariffs. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 0.84 percent, or 187.00 points, to 22,009.89 in early trade while the broader Topix index was down 0.70 percent, or 12.08 points, at 1,704.05. “Sales are seen dominating after US trading in after hours saw declines following media reports that President Trump is nearing the release of an additional list of Chinese exports to the US subject to new US tariffs,” SBI Securities said in a commentary. The US late Tuesday announced it was starting the process to slap 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese export goods as soon as September, escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
