Stay up to date with all the latest news from Russia with Daily Maverick’s dedicated World Cup 2018 section. The 2018 World Cup is heading into its final stages and this year’s Golden Boot winner will have more goals than the winner in 2014. James Rodríguez bagged six in Brazil, but Harry Kane has already matched that.  1 It’s worth noting a few of the big names no longer in contention. Cristiano Ronaldo (four goals) and Diego Costa (three) are out of the running after being eliminated. These are the players still in with a chance and the goals that have put them there. Harry Kane (England) Hat-trick hero in England’s opening match, he’s added three more since then, averaging a goal every 46 minutes. Remarkably, those six goals have come from eight shots. Three of those have been penalties, but it’s not how you get them that matters. Not if you’re English, anyway. A selection of Harry Kane’s goals at the 2018 World Cup   Romelu Lukaku (Belgium) Four goals at an average of one every 60 minutes at the World Cup so far. He scored a brace against both Tunisia and Panama before sitting out the final group game against England. He failed to add to his tally in the barking mad knockout against Japan, but did set up the dummy run that helped Nacer Chadli clinch the late winner.

Dzyuba, though, found the equaliser against Spain that would eventually help propel Russia into the quarter-finals of a dream home competition. A selection of Dzyuba and Cheryshev’s goals at the 2018 World Cup  Kylian Mbappé (France) A revelation to the uninitiated, Mbappé became France’s youngest scorer at a World Cup and the first teenager since Pele to score two goals in a match at the tournament. Packed with pace, fleet of foot and a whirlwind around defenders. His first goal of the tournament came against Peru in the group stage before he dazzled with a brace in the last 16 against Argentina. A selection of  Mbappé’s goals at the 2018 World Cup  Edinson Cavani (Uruguay) His double against Portugal, plus the back and forth he set up with Luis Suarez, stands out as a highlight of the tournament so far. Both were clutch goals and his tally so far is already a marked improved from his single strike in each of the last two World Cups, in South Africa and Brazil. And both in losing efforts to boot.
